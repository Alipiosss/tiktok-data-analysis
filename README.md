# TikTok Data Analysis 📱📊

This project was developed as part of the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate - Course 3 Project].

It explores a TikTok dataset using Python and Tableau to extract insights about video views, likes, duration, and engagement.

## 🔍 Objective
To perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and communicate findings through visualizations and an executive summary.

## 📂 Files
- `tiktok_dataset.csv` — Original dataset
- `tiktok_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with data exploration, cleaning, and visualization
- `executive_summary.pdf` — 1-page summary of findings and recommendations
- Link to Tableau Story: [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/shared/43JHKCSBP?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


## 📈 Key Insights
- Most videos are between **10K and 210K likes**, with a median around **72K**.
- Videos with more than **500K likes** are **clear outliers**.
- Like distribution is **right-skewed** (few viral videos push the upper range).
- Like counts differ significantly between `claim` and `opinion` videos, with most high-like videos falling under the `claim` category.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau (for advanced visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 All visualizations are included in the Jupyter notebook `tiktok_analysis.ipynb`.
